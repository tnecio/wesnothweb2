# Progress log

Running log of an autonomous execution session, updated as work happens so
it survives context compaction and is reviewable afterward. Newest entries
at the bottom. Each entry: what was done, what was decided/guessed without
asking, and what's known-incomplete.

Strategy note (2026-09-06): the phased plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is
strictly sequential (WML → data model → rules → Lua → rendering → UI), but
since the user wants something visible in a browser within a few hours,
execution here deliberately front-loads a *thin vertical slice* — enough
WML parsing + data model + rendering to show `Dead_Water`'s first
scenario's map and starting units in the browser via Vite — ahead of full
breadth on any one phase, then deepens each phase with remaining time.
This is a scope/ordering judgment call, not a change to the plan itself.

## 2026-09-06/07: Phase 0 scaffold + Phase 1 dispatch

- npm workspaces monorepo scaffolded (`packages/{engine,lua-bridge,renderer,ui}`,
  `apps/web`), Vite dev server confirmed serving a placeholder Svelte app
  end-to-end (verified via curl against a live server on :5173).
- `wesnoth` submodule added as a **shallow** clone (`--depth 1`,
  `wesnothlite` branch, `shallow = true` in `.gitmodules`) after an earlier
  full-history clone (~4GB) was caught and redone — flagged by the user,
  worth remembering for any future submodule/clone work: always shallow
  unless told otherwise.
- Bumped vite/vitest/vite-plugin-svelte past initially-installed versions
  after `npm audit` found dev-server CVEs (a critical vitest UI-server
  arbitrary-file-read, a high vite path-traversal) — not exploitable in
  production builds, but the dev server binds to all interfaces here.
- Defined `packages/engine/src/wml/config.ts` (`WmlConfig`) myself as a
  fixed shared contract — the parse-tree shape both the WML pipeline and
  the data model need to agree on — specifically to let those two be built
  in parallel by separate agents without them inventing incompatible
  shapes.
- Dispatched 5 agents in parallel, each scoped to non-overlapping
  directories: renderer port-forward (ipf/ImageCache/teamColor/hex-geometry
  from the old attempt), native oracle-tooling setup (wl-image-oracle +
  scaffolding for wl-wml-oracle/wl-rng-oracle), WML tokenizer+preprocessor+
  parser, the WFL formula interpreter, and the core data model
  (map/terrain/unit/team/game-board). Results and integration to follow in
  the next log entries.

## 2026-09-07: rate limit hit, Phase 1 finished directly

Both the WML-pipeline and core-data-model agents were cut off mid-task by
an account-wide spend limit (reset ~2:10am UTC) partway through. Rather
than wait, picked up their (already-substantial, already-typechecking)
work directly rather than re-spawning agents, since a shared account limit
would likely reject new agent spawns too.

- **WML pipeline**: verified it actually parses Dead_Water's real scenario
  1 end-to-end (not just synthetic snippets) -- required two "game-level"
  macro flags (`CAMPAIGN_DEAD_WATER`, the difficulty flag `NORMAL`) that
  upstream's `game_config_manager` injects before preprocessing, not
  something `preprocessor.cpp`'s job. Documented as a real integration
  test (`test/wml/deadWaterIntegration.test.ts`) and in ARCHITECTURE-
  adjacent code comments for whoever writes the scenario loader in Phase 2.
- **Found and fixed a real preprocessor bug** while chasing this down: any
  directive that consumes through end-of-line (plain `# comment`,
  `#textdomain`, `#undef`, `#error`, `#warning`, `#deprecated`, `#else`/
  `#endif`) was dropping the newline it consumed from the *output* text,
  silently merging that line with the next one. Not a narrow edge case --
  `data/core/terrain.cfg` hit it on an ordinary trailing `# comment` after
  a value, and any real WML file could. Fixed all 7 call sites; see the
  commit for the one look-alike spot (inside macro-body capture) that was
  traced by hand and confirmed NOT to need the same fix (would have
  double-spaced instead).
- **Core data model**: finished `Team.ts` and `GameBoard.ts` (the two files
  the interrupted agent hadn't reached yet) on top of its already-solid
  `Location`/`Map`/`Terrain`/`MoveType`/`Unit`/`UnitType`. Wrote a
  real-content integration test loading Dead_Water scenario 1's actual map
  file and `[side]`/`[unit]` data through `GameBoard.fromConfig`, which
  caught a genuine bug in that same new code: inline `[side]` leaders with
  no explicit `x=`/`y=` (the normal case -- confirmed neither of this
  scenario's two leaders have one) all resolved to the same invalid-
  location sentinel and silently overwrote each other. Fixed with a
  `map.startingPosition(side)` fallback, matching upstream's real
  placement logic. The test also surfaced (and now documents rather than
  asserts around incorrectly) a *known, expected* Phase 1 limitation: units
  placed via `[event]`-nested `[unit]` tags from what are really two
  different, mutually-exclusive scenario events can collide on the same
  hex when naively loaded "all at once," because nothing here understands
  event timing yet -- that needs Phase 2's WML event pump, not a Phase 1
  data-model fix.
- Real unit-type-database loading (`data/core/units/`, which needs
  `[base_unit]`/gender-variation inheritance flattening that `UnitType.
  fromConfig`'s own module doc explicitly defers) is NOT done -- the
  GameBoard test uses a permissive stub `resolveType`. This is the next
  concrete gap, not yet a blocker for anything attempted so far.
- All 83 engine tests + 45 renderer tests + 3 oracle-tools tests passing,
  clean typecheck across every package. Phase 1 is DONE for its stated
  milestone (load real Dead_Water scenario 1 into a queryable in-memory
  model, headless).

## 2026-09-07: renderer + oracle tooling landed

- Renderer port-forward (ipf/ImageCache/teamColor/hex-geometry/tween/
  terrainPositioning) landed with 45 passing tests, committed. Fixed a
  tsconfig `rootDir`/`include` conflict (`TS6059`) proactively across all
  packages before the other agents' test files could hit the same wall.
- **Oracle tooling landed and works**: `wl-image-oracle` builds and runs
  (confirmed producing correct 72x72 PNGs for real locators, including a
  `~MASK(...)` hex case) via a minimal CMake target
  (`-DENABLE_IMAGE_ORACLE=ON`) that does NOT pull in the full SDL2_mixer/
  pango/fontconfig desktop build (`ENABLE_GAME=OFF` genuinely gates that
  off, confirmed rather than assumed). `packages/oracle-tools/` wraps it
  with a `runOracle.ts` helper and passing Vitest tests against checked-in
  fixtures. Build reproduction steps in `packages/oracle-tools/README.md`
  and `docs/ORACLE_BUILD_NOTES.md`.
- **Judgment call flagged for user review, not acted on autonomously**:
  the oracle source (`wl_image_oracle.cpp` + its CMake wiring) turned out
  to only exist as *unpushed local commits* in the old `wesnothweb`
  project's checkout (`/home/tom/wesnothweb/wesnoth`, 5 commits ahead of
  `origin/wesnothlite`) — never actually on GitHub. Those unpushed commits
  also contain a committed ~19MB binary and an actual crash core dump
  (`build-oracle/wl-image-oracle`, `build-oracle/core`), so I did not push
  that history as-is. Instead I re-committed just the source-level wiring
  (no binaries; added `build-oracle/` to the submodule's `.gitignore`) as
  a clean new commit on top of the current `origin/wesnothlite` tip,
  **directly in the `wesnoth` submodule checkout** — but pushing it to
  `github.com/tnecio/wesnoth` was blocked by the permission system as an
  action affecting a different repository than this session, which is the
  right call. **This means the fix currently exists only in this VM's
  local submodule checkout, not on GitHub** — a fresh clone of
  `wesnothweb2` elsewhere would not get a working oracle build until this
  is pushed. To publish it: `cd wesnoth && git push origin wesnothlite`
  (fast-forward, no force needed, no binaries in the diff — I checked).
  The outer repo's submodule pointer hasn't been bumped to this commit
  either, for the same reason (would reference an unpublished commit).
