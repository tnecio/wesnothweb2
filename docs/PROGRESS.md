# Progress log

Running log of an autonomous execution session, updated as work happens so
it survives context compaction and is reviewable afterward. Newest entries
at the bottom. Each entry: what was done, what was decided/guessed without
asking, and what's known-incomplete.

Strategy note (2026-09-06): the phased plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is
strictly sequential (WML → data model → rules → Lua → rendering → UI), but
since the user wants something visible in a browser within a few hours,
execution here deliberately front-loads a *thin vertical slice* — enough
WML parsing + data model + rendering to show `Dead_Water`'s first
scenario's map and starting units in the browser via Vite — ahead of full
breadth on any one phase, then deepens each phase with remaining time.
This is a scope/ordering judgment call, not a change to the plan itself.

## 2026-09-06/07: Phase 0 scaffold + Phase 1 dispatch

- npm workspaces monorepo scaffolded (`packages/{engine,lua-bridge,renderer,ui}`,
  `apps/web`), Vite dev server confirmed serving a placeholder Svelte app
  end-to-end (verified via curl against a live server on :5173).
- `wesnoth` submodule added as a **shallow** clone (`--depth 1`,
  `wesnothlite` branch, `shallow = true` in `.gitmodules`) after an earlier
  full-history clone (~4GB) was caught and redone — flagged by the user,
  worth remembering for any future submodule/clone work: always shallow
  unless told otherwise.
- Bumped vite/vitest/vite-plugin-svelte past initially-installed versions
  after `npm audit` found dev-server CVEs (a critical vitest UI-server
  arbitrary-file-read, a high vite path-traversal) — not exploitable in
  production builds, but the dev server binds to all interfaces here.
- Defined `packages/engine/src/wml/config.ts` (`WmlConfig`) myself as a
  fixed shared contract — the parse-tree shape both the WML pipeline and
  the data model need to agree on — specifically to let those two be built
  in parallel by separate agents without them inventing incompatible
  shapes.
- Dispatched 5 agents in parallel, each scoped to non-overlapping
  directories: renderer port-forward (ipf/ImageCache/teamColor/hex-geometry
  from the old attempt), native oracle-tooling setup (wl-image-oracle +
  scaffolding for wl-wml-oracle/wl-rng-oracle), WML tokenizer+preprocessor+
  parser, the WFL formula interpreter, and the core data model
  (map/terrain/unit/team/game-board). Results and integration to follow in
  the next log entries.
